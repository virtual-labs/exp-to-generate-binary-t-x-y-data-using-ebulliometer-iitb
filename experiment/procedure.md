## Procedure

1. Purge the System with Nitrogen gas to remove contaminants.
    1. Open the outlet of Raal’s apparatus.
    2. Start Nitrogen Gas.
    3. Allow gas to flow through the system for few minutes.
    4. Shut off nitrogen supply after pop up massage for purging completion is displayed.

2. Generating boiling point data at Atmospheric pressure.
    1. Select the system and composition from the dropdown list.
    2. Close the outlet of Raal’s apparatus and open the inlet.
    3. Close the inlet of Raal’s apparatus after it is filled.
    4. Start cold water pump.
    5. Start Heating coil.
    6. Increase heating rate slowly by moving the sliding bar.
    7. Allow system to accommodate change in the heat.
    8. Observe the change in the temperature.
    9. Do the same until small increment in heating rate won’t rising temperature.
    10. Take the liquid and vapor samples.
    11. Repeat the procedure for different compositions. 

3. Sample Analysis.
    1. Make 4 samples containing known mass of individual components of system + external standard (ES).
    2. Calibrate GC with this sample and note down the area for each.
    3. Plot the graph of mass ratio of component to ES Vs area ratio of component to ES.
    4. Calculate slope.
    5. Analyze samples using GC.
    6. Use slope and basic information of individual compounds (i.e. molecular wt., Density,…) to calculate mole fraction.
